class TaskMaster(object):
    '''Control object for the rejester task queue.

    The task queue consists of a series of *work specs*, which include
    configuration information, and each work spec has some number of
    *work units* attached to it.  Both the work specs and work units
    are defined as (non-empty) dictionaries.  The work spec must have
    keys ``name`` and ``min_gb``, but any other properties are permitted.
    Conventionally ``desc`` contains a description of the job and
    ``config`` contains the top-level global configuration.

    There are three ways to use :class:`TaskMaster`:

    1. Create work specs and work units with :meth:`update_bundle`.
       Directly call :meth:`get_work` to get work units back.  Based
       on the information stored in the work spec and work unit
       dictionaries, do the work manually, and call
       :meth:`WorkUnit.finish` or :meth:`WorkUnit.fail` as
       appropriate.

    2. Create work specs and work units with :meth:`update_bundle`.
       The work spec must contain three keys, ``module`` naming a Python
       module, and ``run_function`` and ``terminate_function`` each
       naming functions of a single parameter in that module.  Directly
       call :meth:`get_work` to get work units back, then call their
       :meth:`WorkUnit.run` function to execute them.  See the basic
       example in :meth:`WorkUnit.fail`.

    3. Create work specs and work units with :meth:`update_bundle`,
       including the Python information.  Use one of the standard worker
       implementations in :mod:`rejester.workers` to actually run the
       job.

    Most applications will use the third option, the standard worker
    system.  In all three cases populating and executing jobs can
    happen on different systems, or on multiple systems in parallel.
    To use the standard worker system, create a Python module::

        def rejester_run(work_unit):
            # Does the actual work for `work_unit`.
            # Must be a top-level function in the module.
            # The work unit will succeed if this returns normally,
            # and will fail if this raises an exception.
            pass

        def rejester_terminate(work_unit):
            # Called only if a signal terminates the worker.
            # This usually does nothing, but could kill a known subprocess.
            pass

    The work spec would look something like::

        work_spec = {
            'name': 'rejester_sample',
            'desc': 'A sample rejester job.',
            'min_gb': 1,
            'config': yakonfig.get_global_config(),
            'module': 'name.of.the.module.from.above',
            'run_function': 'rejester_run',
            'terminate_function': 'rejester_terminate',
        }

    The work units can be any non-empty dictionaries that are
    meaningful to the run function.  :class:`WorkUnit` objects are
    created with their :attr:`~WorkUnit.key` and :attr:`~WorkUnit.data`
    fields set to individual keys and values from the parameter to
    :meth:`update_bundle`.

    A work unit can be in one of five states.  It is *available* if it
    has been added to the queue but nobody is working on it.  It is
    *pending* if somebody is currently working on it.  When they
    finish, it will become either *finished* or *failed*.  If
    dependencies are added between tasks using `add_dependent_task()`,
    a task can also be *blocked*.

    The general flow for a rejester application is to :meth:`set_mode`
    to :attr:`IDLE`, then add work units using
    :meth:`update_bundle()`, and :meth:`set_mode` to :attr:`RUN`.
    :meth:`get_work` will return work units until all have been
    consumed.  :meth:`set_mode` to :attr:`TERMINATE` will instruct
    workers to shut down.

    This object keeps very little state locally and can safely be used
    concurrently, including from multiple systems.  Correspondingly,
    any settings here, including :meth:`set_mode`, are persistent even
    beyond the end of the current process.

        The two work units may be attached to different work specs,
        but both must be in this task master's namespace.  `work_unit`
        and `depends_on` are both tuples of (work spec name, work unit
        name, work unit dictionary).  The work specs must already
        exist; they may be created with :meth:`update_bundle` with
        an empty work unit dictionary.  If a work unit dictionary is
        provided with either work unit, then this defines that work
        unit, and any existing definition is replaced.  Either or both
        work unit dictionaries may be :const:`None`, in which case the
        work unit is not created if it does not already exist.  In
        this last case, the other work unit will be added if
        specified, but the dependency will not be added, and this
        function will return :const:`False`.  In all other cases, this
        dependency is added in addition to all existing dependencies
        on either or both work units, even if the work unit dictionary
        is replaced.

        `work_unit` will not be executed or reported as available via
        :meth:`get_work` until `depends_on` finishes execution.  If
        the `depends_on` task fails, then the `hard` parameter
        describes what happens: if `hard` is :const:`True` then
        `work_unit` will also fail, but if `hard` is :const:`False`
        then `work_unit` will be able to execute even if `depends_on`
        fails, it just must have completed some execution attempt.

        Calling this function with ``hard=True`` suggests an ordered
        sequence of tasks where the later task depends on the output
        of the earlier tasks.  Calling this function with
        ``hard=False`` suggests a cleanup task that must run after
        this task (and, likely, several others) are done, but doesn't
        specifically depend on its result being available.

        Returns a dictionary mapping worker ID to :class:`WorkUnit`.
        If a child exists but is idle, that worker ID will map to
        :const:`None`.  The work unit may already be expired or
        assigned to a different worker; this will be reflected in
        the returned :class:`WorkUnit`.

        stale children that have not unregistered themselves but
        no longer exist in any form.
